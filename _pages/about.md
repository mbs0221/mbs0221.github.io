I am an Ph.D. student at the Institute of Information Engineering (IIE), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). I obtained my M.D. in Computer Science from China Agricultural University (CAU) in 2019, and my bachelor in Computer Science from Beijing University of Technology (BJUT) in 2017. My research interests during the past years focus on hardware-assited system security, such as Intel MPK, as well as Confidential Computing (e.g., AMD SEV-SNP, Intel TDX, ARM CCA). Ongoing projects also include hardware-software co-design to support system security. Please find the cv here: in [English](/assets/pdf/CV - EN.pdf), [ä¸­æ–‡](/assets/pdf/CV - zh_CN.pdf).

I have a diverse technical background, starting with **Android and web development** before transitioning into **machine learning research** during my masterâ€™s studies, where I focused on **multi-task learning**.

My exposure to **federated learning** and **AI security & privacy** made me realize the critical security challenges in AI, leading me to shift my focus towards **confidential computing**. During my Ph.D., I specialized in **low-level system security for confidential virtual machines (CVMs)**, exploring **secure system architectures, virtualization security, and trusted execution environments (TEE)**.

### Research Interests

* **Confidential Computing** â€“ CVM security, TEE, virtualization security
* **AI Security & Privacy** â€“ federated learning, adversarial ML, secure AI training & inference

I am passionate about building secure and efficient system architectures to enable next-generation privacy-preserving computing. Letâ€™s connect! ðŸš€
