## About Me
I have a diverse technical background, starting with **Android and web development** before transitioning into **machine learning research** during my master’s studies, where I focused on **multi-task learning**. My exposure to **federated learning** and **AI security & privacy** made me realize the critical security challenges in AI, leading me to shift my focus towards **confidential computing**. During my Ph.D., I specialized in **low-level system security for confidential virtual machines (CVMs)**, exploring **secure system architectures, hardware-assisted security, virtualization security, and trusted execution environments (TEE)**, under the guidance of [Prof. Dongdai Lin](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~ddlin) and [Prof. Wenhao Wang](https://heartever.github.io/). My Ph.D. thesis is titled **Research on the Privilege Separation Mechanisms in Confidential Virtual Machines**.

## Research Interests
🔹 **Confidential Computing** – CVM security, TEE, virtualization security  
🔹 **AI Security & Privacy** – federated learning, adversarial ML, secure AI training & inference  

## Services

- **Reviewer**
  - Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence (EAAI)
  - Knowledge-Based Systems (KBS)
